# Single-Heater-Temperature-Response    

This work presents the dynamic modeling of a heater system, deriving its differential equation and transfer function. Real-time experiments, Simulink simulations, and visual comparisons offer insights into system behavior. Join us to explore theoretical-practical correlations in system dynamics.
